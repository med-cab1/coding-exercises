# Tackle one coding problem a day - one line of codes at a time
I created this repo because sometimes I cannot find readable Python3 solutions to the questions from the common coding practice platforms. The internet does not lack elegant solutions to these problems. But not every solution is annotated enough for me to understand what's going on. So I set out to upload solutions I worked on myself with line-by-line comments interpreting what the codes do. If I used someone else's solution, the source is acknowledged.


Abbreviated names for sources of questions are: Leetcode (LC), Hackerrank(HC), Crack the Technical Interview (CTTI, 3rd ed.) and CodeSignal (CS).

Everyone is welcome to contribute with the only requirement that you annotate your codes thoroughly.
