I created this repo because sometimes I cannot find readable Python3 solutions to the questions on the common platforms.
I have been coding and performing data analytics but data structure and algorithm questions are new to me.
Some solutions I found online are so advanced/elegant that my newbie SWE mind cannot comprehend.
So I tackle one problem at a time, writing codes I can understand one line at a time and try to annotate them with what I did.
Questions are from Leetcode (LC), Hackerrank(HC), and Crack the Technical Interview (CTTI, 3rd ed.).
