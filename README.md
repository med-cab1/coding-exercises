# Tackle one coding problem a day - one line of codes at a time
This repo contains my solutions to common coding practice questions with line-by-line comments interpreting what the codes do. If I used someone else's solution, the source is acknowledged.

Sources of questions are: Leetcode (LC), Hackerrank(HC), Crack the Technical Interview (CTTI, 3rd ed.) and CodeSignal (CS).
